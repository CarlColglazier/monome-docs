# grid and arc basic setup

### [&rarr; download serialosc](https://github.com/monome/serialosc/releases/latest)

serialosc runs in the background and converts serial communication (over USB) into [OSC](/docs/osc). applications can query serialosc to connect to the grid and arc.

**mac: manually install the [FTDI VCP driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP/MacOSX/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_4_2.dmg) as the built-in AppleFTDI driver seems broken.**

**windows: manually install the [FTDI VCP driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) (*not* the D2XX driver)**

**linux: see the [linux setup guide](/docs/linux)**

**raspberry pi: see the [raspbian setup guide](/docs/raspbian)**

## getting started

the [max 7 monome package](/docs/app/package) is a collection of applications and tools for Max 7 which can be used with the free runtime.

see the [applications list](/docs/app) for several more.
