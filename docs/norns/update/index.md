# norns update

be sure to `SYNC` backup any scripts/audio you've added to norns. they should be preserved, but backup just in case of trouble.

_note: if you're actively developing the norns codebase be sure to push any changes you've made as the ~/norns folder will be deleted and replaced_.

## procedure

- download newest update file from [monome/norns](https://github.com/monome/norns/releases). it will have a filename like `norns180603.tgz` where `180603` is the date/version.
- copy this file to the root folder of a FAT-formatted USB thumbdrive.
- insert the thumbdrive into norns and boot up.
- in the menu, go to `SYSTEM > UPDATE`.
- the file is now being copied and prepared.
- you'll be asked to reboot. use SLEEP.
- on next boot the update will install, then the device will shut down.
- start the machine.

## confirming

see `SYSTEM` menu for a version number.
