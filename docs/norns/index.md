# norns

almost there. full docs nearly complete.

see the [beginning guide](norns-legend.pdf).

for a first look at _maiden_ (the web editor) turn on WIFI (connect to your norns via hotspot) and try opening a web browser to `http://norns.local:5000` (if not found, try `http://172.24.1.1:5000` or the appropriate IP address.) more documentation coming!

note: on the bottom of the norns there is a tiny push switch will hard power-off the device in case of a software crash. for general shut down use the _sleep_ menu function. this fully turns off the norns with a proper software shutdown.  

*problems?* e-mail info@monome.org and we can help right away.
