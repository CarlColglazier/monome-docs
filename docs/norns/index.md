# norns

almost there. full docs nearly complete.

see the [beginning guide](norns-legend.pdf).

note: on the bottom of the norns there is a tiny push switch will hard power-off the device in case of a software crash. for general shut down use the _sleep_ menu function. this fully turns off the norns with a proper software shutdown.
