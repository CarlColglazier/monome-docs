an open, interactive instrument that allows the user to imagine and define its function.

tactile and visual feedback. decoupled by design. clear response and intuitive play. when you push a key the input data is sent to the computer (or module, considered a tiny computer). the computer considers this, then perhaps sends back some light data, or changes a sound. use is determined by the chosen application running on the computer: sequencer, sample cutter, tone map, polyrhythm machine are just a few of the many possibilities, and we've put together studies to help you create your own.

* 16 x 8 backlit keys — bright warm white light
* two-tone aluminum assembly — usb powered
* 10.2" x 5.4" x 0.6"
