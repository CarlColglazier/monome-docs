## arc

the monome arc two and arc four were produced in 2011 and 2012.

the principle idea of the arc matches that of the grid: decoupled input and output. here the input is a very high quality optical encoder (knob), with 64 segmented variable-brightness LEDs as output.

interaction between the input and output is similarly determined by the application on the computer. some are listed on the [applications page](/docs/app).

the first edition (shown above) featured a thicker walnut enclosure and pushbutton encoder with orange lighting. the second edition has a thinner walnut enclosure and higher resolution encoders in favor of the pushbutton, with yellow-orange lighting.
