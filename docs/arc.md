rotational controls encircled by dense segmented lighting, completely open for definition.

like the grid, tactile and visual feedback. but instead of a multitude of binary points, the arc has four incredibly precise continuous controls with visual indication to match. connects to computers (and modules) to become a sequencer, physics simulation, granular instrument, or anything you can create yourself.

* four high resolution optical encoders — bright warm white light
* two-tone aluminum assembly — usb powered
* 10.2" x 2.7" x 0.6"
