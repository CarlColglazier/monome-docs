# about

monome is <a href="http://nnnnnnnn.co">brian crabtree</a> and <a href="http://kellicain.com">kelli cain</a>. we met in art school where our initial collaborations included electro-mechanical installations, films, and music. now we live and work in the mountains of upstate new york where we also tend apple orchards, shiitake stacks, and forest paths.
		
monome is operated on a human scale. we use local suppliers and manufacturers with whom we've built long-term, trusting relationships. we believe in beautiful design and quality craftsmanship. staying small affords us the flexibility to pursue interesting new directions, not simply commodify established trends.
		
monome's evolution since 2005 has been recorded over the years in various reviews and interviews, including these: <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2014/06/watch-wonders-grids-monome-makers-defend-minimal-design/">createdigitalmusic</a>, <a href="http://stories.maker.me/monome-open-source-tools-for-music-makers/">maker</a>, <a href="http://cycling74.com/2008/02/11/a-video-and-text-interview-with-monome">cycling74</a>, <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep08/articles/monome.htm">sound on sound</a>, and <a href="http://previous.precious-forever.com/2008/07/09/our-best-protection-is-our-openness/">precious forever</a>.
